## cloud point competition

First my video is too large so that I CAN NOT upload 100M file use git.

So if you want to watch the video ---> first run /src/video/img2video.py then run it after frames already created.

So if you want to recreate my result ---> run /src/video/main.py  and run /src/photos/main.py

Then create the video ---> run /src/video/img2video.py 

By the way after I RUN several frames cost a lot of time, later I come up with a new fliter idea to enhance my photos

So just run enhance.py in /src/video and /src/photos
